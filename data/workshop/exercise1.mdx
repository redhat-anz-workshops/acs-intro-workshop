title: Vulnerability analysis with RHACS
exercise: 1
date: '2024-06-01'
tags: ['rhacs','cve','pwnkit','openshift','acs','containers']
draft: false
authors: ['default']
summary: "In this first exercise we'll analyze container images for vulnerabilities."
---
In this first exercise we'll identify critical vulnerabilities in an OpenShift workload. This is important, because vulnerabilities can be present in either the underlying 'base' container image, or in the application code itself. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) supports identifying vulnerabilities in both.

## Identifying critical vulnerabilities
Navigate to RHACS and login with your OpenShift username and credentials, making sure you select `workshop_users` when prompted.

</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![login2](/exercise1/acs_login2.png)
</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![login3](/exercise1/acs_login3.png)
</Zoom>

Once you've logged in you'll be prompted to authorize access for RHACS. Simply select 'Allow selected permissions'

<Zoom>
![login4](/exercise1/acs_login4.png)
</Zoom>

You'll be shown the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) dashboard once you've logged in.

<Zoom>
![login5](/exercise1/acs_login5.png)
</Zoom>

Navigate to **Vulnerability Management (1.0)**, and select 'images' in the top-right menu.

<Zoom>
![cve1](/exercise1/cve1.png)
</Zoom>

When RHACS is first-connected to an OpenShift cluster it will automatically perform a CVE scan of all images deployed to the cluster. You can see these shown in this screen - the 'Image Status -> Active' indicates that the image is associated with an active deployment.

<Zoom>
![cve2](/exercise1/cve2.png)
</Zoom>

Select the `quay.io/the-worst-containers/pwnkit:v0.6` image. If you can't see it on the first page, you can search for the image in the 'Filter images' bar.

<Zoom>
![cve3](/exercise1/cve3.png)
</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![cve4](/exercise1/cve4.png)
</Zoom>

Once you select the image you'll be shown a screen showing a summary of the image.

</Zoom>

There's a few things we can see here:
- The top CVSS of any vulnerabilities present in this container image is 10.0
- The container image was created 30/05/2024, and was last scanned very recently. 
- The container image was scanned using the built-in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) CVE scanner, based on the open source Clair project.
- The image base OS is Debian 9. Debian 9 no longer produces new CVE data, and RHACS shows a message that the CVE data is now stale. 
- The image has 10 CVEs rated as critical, 36 rated as important, 29 rated as moderate and 200 rated as low. We're mostly interested in the critical and important CVEs.
- The top riskiest components and the number of CVEs identified are also shown.

<details>
    <summary><strong>What does 'stale CVE data' mean?</strong></summary>
    <p>Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) uses CVE data from various sources. The latest Scanner v4 uses OSV.dev as a comprehensive source of CVE feeds and data.</p>

    <p>The image used here is built on Debian 9. Debian publishes security advisories at https://www.debian.org/security/#DSAS, which are then made available via NIST NVD, OSV.dev and other sources. While there is historical CVE data available for Debian 9, there are no new security advisories being created. Hence RHACS shows a 'stale' CVE data message.</p>

    <p>This also highlights the importance of selecting a base image with security errata available. If you don't have security errata and CVE information available for the base image, then it can be difficult to track CVEs through the application lifecycle.</p>
</details>

If you scroll down the page you'll be shown the list of all CVEs present in this container image. Let's filter this list for a specific CVE - CVE-2021-4034.

<details>
    <summary><strong>A little more about PwnKit</strong></summary>
    <p>CVE-2021-4034 refers to a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Polkit package.</p>
</details>

Click `CVE-2021-4034` and you'll be shown a summary of the CVE.

<Zoom>
![cve7](/exercise1/cve7.png)
</Zoom>

The summary contains some other important data about this CVE:
- The CVSS score is 7.8
- The CVE has a patch available (`Fixable`)
- The CVE was first published 29/01/2022, and was first discovered in this environment very recently

You can also see a link the image component on the right-hand side of the screen.

<Zoom>
![cve8](/exercise1/cve8.png)
</Zoom>

Clicking this link will show the vulnerable component inside the container image. In this case, it's the `policykit-1` package installed into the container image. This screen also shows the package that fixes the CVE.

<Zoom>
![cve9](/exercise1/cve9.png)
</Zoom>

You can also dig further into this component and see any other CVEs that it is exposed to.

## Summary

This was a quick introduction to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS). We looked at how to use RHACS to identify vulnerable container images, and dug into vulnerable components inside a container image.

In the next exercise, we'll look at creating a campaign for a specific CVE and extracting data from RHACS.
